## Welcome to the an example grandstack api

Initial code taken from the grandstack starter project: https://grandstack.io/

This project demonstrates:
- Wrapping graphql over neo4j
- Using cypher directives to inject cypher into graphql (e.g to do things like run queries over similar products in a products db) (https://grandstack.io/docs/graphql-schema-directives/)
- Example mutations when interacting with the graphql plaground (see examples folder)
